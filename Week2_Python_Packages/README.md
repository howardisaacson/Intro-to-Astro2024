## Meeting Time: 5:00pm PDT, Monday July 8th 2024.
Zoom channel see Discord or google group


#### Agenda:

1) Review/Checkin from last week:
   - How did the tutorials go?
   - What should the instructors do differently this week?

2) Short Tutorial on pandas (python data spreadsheets). Instructor screenshares, and:
   - Use git to download this repository (git folder).
   - Open Jupyter notebook in this repository from the command line. The instructor will add these commands to the comments in the zoom channel so you can copy paste.
   - Open `pandas_tutorial.ipynb`. To execute each cell, press shift+enter at the same time. The instructor will step through the first few cells, but you'll get to finish this one on your own.

3) Short Tutorial on numpy, scipy and astropy
  - Use git to download this repository (git folder).
  - Study 'Introduction to Numpy, Scipy and Astropy.ipynb'



## Assignments for this Week:

### I Paper of the week:
Paper on a the planetary systems around Proxima Centauri: https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.1706680114

Refer to our [paper reading guide](https://github.com/howardisaacson/Intro-to-Astro-2020/blob/master/Week1_Intro_unix_python/how_to_read_scientific_papers.md) while reading this paper!

Post 2-3 questions you have about this paper on Discord. In addition, please answer at least one of your classmates' questions. You can do this anonymously if you'd like!

### II Respond to Discussion Question 2 in "Discussion Questions" above

### III Numpy:

Main Website:
http://www.numpy.org

Tutorial for this week:
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/quickstart.html

Bonus round: 100 Numpy commands
https://github.com/rougier/numpy-100/blob/master/100_Numpy_exercises.ipynb
(This notebook can be cloned to your local computer)

### IV Pandas:
The `pandas` module is very handy for accessing data in python. You can think of it as a python version of excel filled with columns of data and rows for each item described by those columns. Because `pandas` allows us to create these "spreadsheets" in python, we can do powerful analysis when we combine `pandas` with other modules, like `numpy` and `matplotlib`. Your `pandas` assignment for this week is to complete the tutorial notebook in this section until the challenge section. After you've done this, check out the `pandas` main website where you can find all the documentation describing the use of this python module.

#### 1. Pandas Assignment

   [Tutorial for this week](pandas_tutorial.ipynb)

   Main Website:
   https://pandas.pydata.org

#### 2. Bonus Pandas Assignment

   [Challenge Section of this week's tutorial](pandas_tutorial.ipynb)

   Head over to https://stackoverflow.com and see if you can find a question about `pandas` by searching for it in the search bar. What words do you understand in this question that you didn't understand last week? What words are still new? Ask a question about one of the new words on Discord to find out its definition.

#### 3. More Pandas Tutorials

   https://bitbucket.org/hrojas/learn-pandas/src/master/

### V Numpy, Scipy and Astropy

-Complete the problem 'Problem_Set_on_Numpy_Scipy_Astropy.ipynb''


### VI Scipy (optional):
https://scipy.org

Scipy is an incredibly powerful module for conducting high level scientific computing. Because we are
focusing on the basics of scientific computing in this class, only a single basic tutorial will be assigned.
For those of you who desire more depth, please explore the full tutorials page linked from the scipy homepage.

Tutorial for this week:  
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/interpolate.html
   This tutorial covers a very common tool used in astronomy, interpolation.
