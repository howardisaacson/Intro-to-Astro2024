## First Meeting: July 1st, 2024: 5:00pm Pacific Daylight Time (UT-7).


## Agenda:
* Introductions
* Motivation
* Overview of the course (discuss Github, Discord)
* Tutorial on Unix
* Tutorial on Git/GitHub
* An introduction to Python and Jupyter notebooks
* How to read scientific papers (ADS, Mendeley, arXiv)


## Assignments for Week 1

### If you have not already:
 * Ensure that you have a working version of Python installed on your computer.
   * [This link](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#python) has a section for downloading the Anaconda version of Python for Mac, Linux, or Windows
 * Finish writing your goals for this program if you did not finish during the session.

### Assignment 1) Go through the slides for Unix and complete the 2 assignments written there
1. Perform a set of commands mentioned in the slides 
2. Complete the Data Carpentry workshop on the Unix command shell
The Unix shell is the basis for scientific computing. By mastering shell commands, you will save
yourself hours in the future. What seems like a small investment will pay dividends again and again.

**Link to slides for Unix**: [Slides](https://unix-git-tutorial.netlify.app/)

**Deliverable:**
  On Discord, you can send a file having list of all of the Unix commands that you learned, with a brief description of each.

### Assignment 2) Complete the Git tutorial:

Git is a powerful and ubiquitous versioning tool for software development,
though all of the vocabulary and mechanics can take some getting used to. Work through this Git tutorial to
reinforce some of the features we discussed this week and learn about concepts we didn't have a chance to cover.

**Deliverable**:
  * Go through the commands and do the assignment for Git by following the commands as mentioned on the slides. 
  * Create a GitHub account if you don't already have one! You can sign up at https://github.com.


*Bonus: If you want to learn it in more depth, you can also go through this short [Software Carpentry Workshop](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)*



### Paper of the week: Assignment 3) Read this exoplanet review paper:

* Exoplanets Review by Lee (2018). (https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08907)
* Read the paper, and save a list of questions you may have.
* Read the paper again a few days later, and revisit your list of questions
* Post at least one question on Discord, and respond to at least one of your classmates' questions.
* Link for [How to read scientific papers](https://github.com/howardisaacson/Intro-to-Astro2024/blob/main/Week1_Unix_Git_Papers/how_to_read_scientific_papers.md)



### Bonus Round (Intended for everyone. See how far you can get)
Command line Ninjas begin their training with the simplest commands they use every day and eventually obtain
more and more skills. Follow the link below and see how far you get in the command-line challenge. Be sure to
keep track of your progress so that you can report back.

## Writing Prompt (5-7 mins):
* What are your goals for this course?
* What topics in astronomy interest you? e.g. astrobiology, exoplanets, dark energy, black holes, space launches, mars exploration, the rings of Saturn, Earth-like planets, etc.
