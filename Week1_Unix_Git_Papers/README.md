* Overleaf.com, and kaggle.com will be discussed in later weeks.


## Assignments for Week 1

### If you have not already:
 * Be sure to obtain all of the appropriate accounts listed on Timeline page.
 * Ensure that you have a working version of Python installed on your computer.
   * [This link](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#python) has a section for downloading the anaconda version of Python for Mac, Linux or Windows
 * Finish writing your goals for this program if you did not finish during the session.

### Assignment 1) Complete the Data Carpentry workshop on the Unix command shell
The Unix shell is the basis for scientific computing. By mastering shell commands you will save
yourself hours of time in the future. What seems like a small investment will pay dividends again and again.

Right now, follow this link to the setup page. You will need to do this on your own, either with the class or offline.

Link to the assigned tutorial:
http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/

Deliverable:
  In your individual folder, list all of the unix commands that you learned, with a brief description of each.

### Assignment 2) Complete the Git tutorial on the Software Carpentry website:

Git is a powerful and ubiquitous versioning tool for software development,
though all of the vocabulary and mechanics can take some getting used to. Work through this Git tutorial to
reinforce some of the features we discussed this week and learn about concepts we didn't have a chance to cover.

Deliverable:
  Create a GitHub account if you don't already have one! You can sign up at https://github.com.


### Paper of the week: Assignment 3) Read this exoplanet review paper:

* Exoplanets Review by Lee (2018). (https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08907)
* Read the paper, and save a list of questions you may have.
* Read the paper again a few days later, and revisit your list of questions
* Post at least one question on Discord, and respond to at least one of your classmates' questions.



### Bonus Round (Intended for everyone. see how far you can get)
Command line Ninjas begin their training with the most simple commands they use everyday and eventually obtain
more and more skills. Follow the link below and see how far you get in the command-line-challenge. Be sure to
keep track of you progress so that you can report back.
